ESTABLISH BASELINE
first train mixed model

second train amdo only model
show that dialect specific model works better


REPRODUCE OLD PROBLEM
attempt to finetune amdo model with added dialects from mixed training data
show that this deteriorates performance

attempt to finetune amdo model with all mixed data
show that this preserves performance

DEMONSTRATE LORA BENEFITS
finetune amdo lora for baseline model 
show improvements without loss of baseline performance
