if phonetic helps with translation: (confirmed)
- generate phonetic
- use phonetic as context to generate translation
    (check if phonetic helps post editing)

if translation helps phonetics:
    check if translation helps post-editing phonetics
    if not, try just regenerating phonetic and see if its better
    

possibly:
- generate phonetics
- generate translation using phonetics as context
- use both as context to produce post edits of each or of both simultaneously (possibly looping over post edits with improved context)
